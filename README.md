Phase I (Console) â€“ Text-based Budget and Bill Tracking:

In Phase I, the project works as a console-based application where users can manage their personal budget and bills in a simple, text-driven environment.
Interface: Runs entirely in the terminal/console. Users interact through text-based menus and commands.
Budget Tracking: Allows users to set a budget, record expenses, and monitor spending within the same session.
Bill Tracking: Users can add, update, and view their bills (like electricity, rent, internet, etc.) while the session is active.
Temporary Storage: All data is stored in memory only. Once the session is closed, the data is cleared (no database or file storage yet).
Session-based Flow: Users can continuously add and check expenses/bills as long as the program is running.

Purpose of Phase I:
The goal of this phase is to validate the idea and provide a minimal working prototype that demonstrates how a simple budget and bill tracker can function, before moving on to advanced phases like persistent storage, graphical UI, or web integration
